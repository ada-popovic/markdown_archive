# Artefact
In the archive of International Institute of Social History there is a fascinating object. It is a plastic snow globe with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels inside of it. The object even in it's purest, today's form already poses a multitude of questions and allows for various interpretations. However, what will happen with it in the future? How can we preserve a feeling of holding that snow globe when global warming already threatens the very existence of snow? And Marx - how does putting him in a tchotchke change his image and his ideology? What is the meaning of the snow globe's caption ('Schnee van gestern?')?

Asking (while not necessarily answering), those and other questions is the main premise of the Archival Resilience Project conducted in 2020 in KABK by its 40 students under supervision of Hannes Bernard and Martijn de Heer.

|![Original image on IISG website](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")| The image shows the original *Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* as held in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. Transparent plastic globe with a flat, round, 3-legged base of black plastic contains a figure of sitting Karl Marx and standing Friedrich Engels next to him. The diameter of the base is around 12cm and the height of the globe around 10cm. Judging by the colour and texture, the figures are most probably made out of clay, however there is no firm proof, as the inside of the globe cannot be accessed. On the back of the box-shaped element Karl Marx is sitting on, there is an inscription "CLAY Genet". The inscription seems to be incised directly into the material by hand, not imprinted automatically. As the 'CLAY' part of the inscription could be a clue to the type of material used, the meaning of 'Genet' remains a mystery. In front of the figures, on the inner white base of the globe (on which the figures are positioned), the words 'Schnee van gestern!?' are printed in black ink in decorative script typeface. Both figures are submerged in soapy, murky water. Initially intended to fill out the whole globe, now the liquid reaches to only about half the height of the object. In the water there are floating particles of what seems to be small white plastic shavings. The snowglobe fits in human hand in order to facilitate shaking the object. When the globe is shook, the white plastic particles are supposed to imitate a snowfall, as after initial shake-induced blizzard-like chaos, gradually slowed down by the water resistance, they calmly travel back to the bottom of the object.

# Research

What constitutes this fascinating artefact is its eclecticism, the fact that on one hand the globe evokes feelings of nostalgia, calmness, lightness, while figures of Marx and Engels bring on certain political seriousness, remind the viewer of the controversial subjects of marxism and communism and their consequences. The connection of those two elements, together with baffling inscriptions, completes an image of an object that in its simplicity of form, is surprisingly complex and absurd.

In order to comprehensibly portray the richness, ridiculousness and metaphorical value of *Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* an explanation of its individual elements, history and socio-political context should be introduced first. Essentially, any snowglobe can be divided into three parts: [**The Globe**](#The-Globe) itself, [**The Subject**](#The-Subject) (figure, picture placed inside of it) and [**The Inscription**](#The-Inscription)or any textual content accompanying it (if there is any).

# The Globe

Preserving relatability of a snow globe logically starts with an explanation of what the obviousd subject matter, **snow**, is.

## Snow

### Definitions

What the noun 'snow' can mean:
- atmospheric water vapour frozen into ice crystals and falling in light white flakes or lying on the ground as a white layer.
- precipitation in the form of small white ice crystals formed directly from the water vapour of the air at a temperature of less than 32°F (0°C)
- snow white - shade of colour white
- visual snow syndrome causes a person to see numerous flickering tiny dots that fill the entire visual field in both eyes
![Visual Snow](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
- a mass of flickering white spots on a television or radar screen, caused by interference or a poor signal (tv static snow)
![Static snow tv](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
![Static snow movement](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
- cocaine, heroin (slang)


Etymology in different languages
- English snow, snaw, snāw (Old English)
- Proto-Germanic snaiwaz
- Proto-Indo-European snóygʷʰos
- West Frisian snie
- Dutch sneeuw
- German Schnee
- Danish sne
- Norwegian snø
- Swedish snö
- Icelandic snjór
- Latin nix
- Polish śnieg
- Russian снег
- Sanskrit स्नेह


### Water, Vapour, Ice

Snow consists of hexagonally bound molecules of water. It represents water's solid state of matter (created when 0 degrees Celsius or less is reached). It preserves the transformative value of the hydrogen-oxygen bonds, as it can sublimate back into liquid or gas state at a temperature above 0 Celsius.

### Global perspective

Thanks to global warming, naturally occuring snow is a vision gradually more and more rare. As much as mountain peaks are whitened with snow pretty much all year long, the majority of land lucky enough to be in cold/moderate climate, experiences a snowfall only in winter season. With the lowering of temperature, a chance of snowfall increases.

The warmer countries around equator, without any mountains are the ones least likely to experience snow. Of course, with global warming and all the glaciers melting, the number of countries without snow will gradually grow larger. For example, there used to be a small ski area called Chacaltaya on a tall mountain in Bolivia, but that ski area has already closed permanently because of lack of snow.

### Emotional charge

Snow can, depending on the cintext it appears in, evoke both positive and negative connections.

Generally speaking, snow operates on the border of seductive magicality and cold unapproachability, as shown below in a selection of pop-culturally established stories connected to strong presence of snow.

## Snowglobe

As snow exists somewhere between magical dust and natural disaster, so does an object of a snowglobe position itself on the border of cheap tchotchke and priceless memorabilia.

### Layers

Every snowglobe consists of the following layers:

**The Name**

known as snow domes , snow shakers, water domes, water balls, snow scenes and blizzard weights

**The Snow Material**

The ''snow'' was made of ground rice, bone, ceramic, camphor and wax or porcelain; today it is almost always tiny bits of plastic.

- isn't that accurate? it used to be snowing snow, but now, because of our need to own things, it snowing plastic.

how accurate is it that in the majority of mainstream snowglobes, which are supposed to be reminiscent of a magical event of snow globe, it already snows plastic (instead more natural materials like rice, wax, bone). Perhaps one day the snow on our Earth globe will follow. As the natural occurence of snow decreasee, the amount of plastic covering our planet increases.

One of our unique designs included a 120mm snowglobe on a solid silver base which was given to President Bill Clinton. The snowglobe **contained the original confetti which was thrown at his inauguration party.**

**The Liquid**

In the 1960's, several children got sick when they drank the contents of domes filled with polluted water taken directly from Hong Kong Harbor. In the 1950's, one manufacturer, finding that water froze when his inventory was being shipped, began adding antifreeze. Today, many manufacturers still add potentially lethal chemicals to prevent freezing and to thicken the water so the flakes drift through slowly.

**The Vessel**

In the early 1950's, plastic began to take the place of glass as a material for the globe itself.

### Snow globe - more than a tchotchke

>While at first glance, snow globes might seem trite or trivial objects, on closer reflection, they are revealed to be symbolic realms that provide clues to the desires, dreams, nightmares, and memories of the cultures that produce them.

>A snowglobe can seem a frustrating object because it does not appear to offer opportunities to create change, only the temporary disruption of a snowstorm or total disruption by smashing.

>Thinking critically about the hermetically sealed worlds of snow globes
opens up riddles of modern life. It brings attention to our size, to ourselves, and to the worlds we inhabit and create. The art of catastrophe expressed in disaster snow globes points out our faults and our fears, but allows us to give them a shake. As we shake them, they shake us.

# The Subject

### Marx and Engels

![marxengels](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")

Karl Marx, in full Karl Heinrich Marx, (born May 5, 1818, Trier, Rhine province, Prussia [Germany]—died March 14, 1883, London, England), revolutionary, sociologist, historian, and economist. He published (with Friedrich Engels) Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei (1848), commonly known as The Communist Manifesto, the most celebrated pamphlet in the history of the socialist movement. He also was the author of the movement’s most important book, Das Kapital. These writings and others by Marx and Engels form the basis of the body of thought and belief known as Marxism. (See also socialism; communism.)

Friedrich Engels, (born Nov. 28, 1820, Barmen, Rhine province, Prussia [Germany]—died Aug. 5, 1895, London, Eng.), German socialist philosopher, the closest collaborator of Karl Marx in the foundation of modern communism. They coauthored The Communist Manifesto (1848), and Engels edited the second and third volumes of Das Kapital after Marx’s death.

### Similar Objects in IISG

Apart from the Snowglobe With Marx And Engels, there are other objects connected to the German philosopher

![object1](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
![object2](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
![object3](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
![object4](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")

Seeing the mentioned snowglobe next to these objects, we cannot help, but notice that they are not primarily objects of preservation, but rather of mockery.

In the modern age, after the fall of USSR, we are experiencing a new approach to the icons of communism, especially in post-soviet countries. Dictators (Stalin), leaders (Lenin) or idealists (Marx) are commodified and turned into symbols, often ending up as a low quality T-shirt print or edgy cup available online or next to major tourist attraction from Warsaw to Budapest.

![tshirt](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
![matches](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
![cup](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")

There are however some objects which pose a certain difficulty in judging their intended use. This snowglobe with an image of Stalin from Stalin Museum in Georgia looks like a cheao souvenir, but there is a chance it was an actual dear reminder of the beloved leader kept safely at home by his admirers.
![georgiastalin](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")

### The Face In A globe

Generally speaking, in order to achieve a similar effect of absurdity that this specific artefact holds, it doesn't matter that it's Marx's figure put in there. It could be Stalin, Mao, any 'politically serious' person of recent past with mostly negative or at least controversial connotations and we would relate to it in a similar way - in the future it might be Trump or Putin that will land in such a globe, if they haven't already.

List of traits for someone's figure to be put in that globe and have similar effect of absurdity:
  1. recognizable face
  2. a person with serious background (as in powerful enough to have caused some socio-political stir)
  3. general public has negative or at least controversial connotations to that person
  4. person of recent past (wouldn't work with king from 500 years ago)

However, it is specifically Marx that we see in there, so a few possibly over-interpreted connections come to mind of a contemporary viewer:

1. Shaking a snow globe = communist revolution that shook the world (and yet it all goes back to calmness as snow falls in a globe)
2. Devaluation of a snowglobe is parallel to certain devaluation of Marx
  - snow globes were once expensive memorabilia, now a cheap souvenir
  - Marx was once a person of serious hope, idealist, a **real** person, later turned into an ideological icon by bad propaganda (positioned next to Lenin, Stalin etc), an icon that never really existed:
      - *Marx as the one who offered salvation to proletariat*
      - *Marx as the prophet*

3. Commodification of marxism especially in post-soviet countries (edgy souvenirs) is parallel to commodification of a snow globe (valued memorabilia → cheap tchotchke)


# The Inscriptions

On the snowglobe we can find two textual additions: 'CLAY GENET' on the back of the sculpture and 'Schnee von gestern?!' in front of it

## *CLAY GENET*

### Meaning

Unfortunately, the IISG is unable to inform what is the meaning of that inscription. Research leads only as far as to show that Genet is a slender cat-like animal with a long body, a long ringed tail, large ears, a pointed muzzle and partly retractile claws.

![genet](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")

And there are figurines of it made out of clay.

![claygenet](/assets/images/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")

However, there does not seem to be any connection between a genet and Marx.

### Function

The reason why inscription was made is unknown. It is supposed that it can be the name of the author, but no such person was found. Moreover, the snowglobe is probably an example of a mass produced object (which is rarely individually signed). The only information about the origin of the artefact is that it once was spotted on a souvenir market by a staff member of IISG and brought back to the archive, mostly as a bit of a joke, but also to enrich its collection on Marx.

## *Schnee von gestern?!*

### Meaning

The inscription is made in German and literally translates to *Snow of yesterday* or *Yesterday's snow*.

"Schnee von gestern" is a way of saying that something is already a thing of the past, something old, unimportant that has no more relevance to the discussed topic or is not worthy of worrying about. Its English synonym is 'water under the bridge'.

There are three German documentary movies entitled *Schnee von gestern*
- by director Michael Würfel from 2008
- by the directors Claus Oppermann and Gerald Grote from 2008
- by director Yael Reuveny from 2013

None of them relates to the artefact.

### Function

Function of the inscription is unknown, but there are some clues. *Snow of yesterday?!* in a snowglobe is an obvious play on words. Exclamation and question mark at the end of the sentence suggest teasing the viewer to question the object and the person it encapsulates with its plastic vessel. The final effect is a certain commentary pun, making the one who hold the artefact wonder, whether the ideology of Marxism is the thing of the past, whether the world will be shook by it again and what all of it really means.


# Transcoding
The resilience of any archived object largely relies on its adaptability to a variety of media. Technology comes in, but also dies out at dizzying pace. Innovative technologies (CD, VHS), prevailing the market just 20 years ago are now considered out of date, which majorly impedes the process of retrieving the information held on them.

The artefact of *The Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* has been translated into different formats - using both coding and more analogue techniques of such inter-media translation. Every attempt at transcoding takes on a different aspect of the globe, analysing and preserving it, in hope that when viewed collectively, transcoded versions of the original will be able to reflect not only the physicality of the *The Snowglobe*, but also its socio-political relevance and emotional response it may have once evoked.

### Description

### Disappearing snow

In the near future the word *snow* might become an anachronism. As global warming progresses, snow is more and more of a rare sight. And without its natural occurence, its relatability is lost. Phenomena like TV static/snow, visual snow or yesterday's snow would be named differently if snow did not exist anymore.

https://ada-popovic.github.io/markdown_archive/capital/

Usually snow globe has only image-based content inside of it (as in pictures or sculptures). In this transcoding I would like to not only put words into the globe, but also through multi-level construction allow for arbitrary narrative creation. Each small globe within a greater construction would be similar to a Magic8Ball.

In an analogue version each globe would have a small transparent opening at the top and a dice inside of it. After the globe has been shook one of the sides of the dice floats to the top, revealing a word. Among other consecutive words a narrative is created.

In a digital version the construction would rely on randomly selected words from a few array (one array for each globe).


### Selection of quotes from *Das Kapital*

“Education is free. Freedoom of education shall be enjoyed under the condition fixed by law and under the supreme control of the state”

“As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.10”

“Perseus wore a magic cap down over his eyes and ears as a make-believe that there are no monsters.”

"Work, thrift and greed are therefore his three cardinal virtues."

### Nouns

Singular
- education
- freedom
- law
- state
- religion
- brain
- hand
- perseus
- magic cap
- work
- thrift
- greed

Plural
- products
- virtues
- monsters















# Reflection
You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below.

# Outcomes
This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible.

### Outcome Links
Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored.

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).   

# Conclusion
You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :)
