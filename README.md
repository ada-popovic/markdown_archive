## Artefact
In the archive of International Institute of Social History there is a fascinating object. It is a plastic snow globe with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels inside of it. The object even in it's purest, today's form already poses a multitude of questions and allows for various interpretations. However, what will happen with it in the future? How can we preserve a feeling of holding that snow globe when global warming already threatens the very existence of snow? And Marx - how does putting him in a tchotchke change his image and his ideology? What is the meaning of the snow globe's caption ('Schnee van gestern?!')?

Asking (while not necessarily answering), those and other questions is the main premise of the Archival Resilience Project conducted in 2020 in KABK by its 40 students under supervision of Hannes Bernard and Martijn de Heer.

|![](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/main_picture_marx.png "Schnee von gestern?")| The image shows the original *Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* as held in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. Transparent plastic globe with a flat, round, 3-legged base of black plastic contains a figure of sitting Karl Marx and standing Friedrich Engels next to him. The diameter of the base is around 12cm and the height of the globe around 10cm. Judging by the colour and texture, the figures are most probably made out of clay, however there is no firm proof, as the inside of the globe cannot be accessed. On the back of the box-shaped element Karl Marx is sitting on, there is an inscription "CLAY Genet". The inscription seems to be incised directly into the material by hand, not imprinted automatically. As the 'CLAY' part of the inscription could be a clue to the type of material used, the meaning of 'Genet' remains a mystery. In front of the figures, on the inner white base of the globe (on which the figures are positioned), the words 'Schnee von gestern!?' are printed in black ink in decorative script typeface. Both figures are submerged in soapy, murky water. Initially intended to fill out the whole globe, now the liquid reaches to only about half the height of the object. In the water there are floating particles of what seems to be small white plastic shavings. The snowglobe fits in human hand in order to facilitate shaking the object. When the globe is shook, the white plastic particles are supposed to imitate a snowfall, as after initial shake-induced blizzard-like chaos, gradually slowed down by the water resistance, they calmly travel back to the bottom of the object.

## Research

What constitutes this fascinating artefact is its eclecticism, the fact that on one hand the globe evokes feelings of nostalgia, calmness, lightness, while figures of Marx and Engels bring on certain political seriousness, remind the viewer of the controversial subjects of marxism and communism and their consequences. The connection of those two elements, together with baffling inscriptions, completes an image of an object that in its simplicity of form, is surprisingly complex and absurd.

In order to comprehensibly portray the richness, ridiculousness and metaphorical value of *Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* an explanation of its individual elements, history and socio-political context should be introduced first. Essentially, any snowglobe can be divided into three parts: [**The Globe**](#The-Globe) itself, [**The Subject**](#The-Subject) (figure, picture placed inside of it) and [**The Inscription**](#The-Inscription)or any textual content accompanying it (if there is any).

## The Globe

Preserving relatability of a snow globe logically starts with an explanation of what the obvious subject matter, **snow**, is.

### Snow

**Definitions**

What the noun 'snow' can mean:
- atmospheric water vapour frozen into ice crystals and falling in light white flakes or lying on the ground as a white layer.
- precipitation in the form of small white ice crystals formed directly from the water vapour of the air at a temperature of less than 32°F (0°C)
- snow white - shade of colour white
- cocaine, heroin (slang)

**Water, Vapour, Ice**

Snow consists of hexagonally bound molecules of water. It represents water's solid state of matter (created when 0 degrees Celsius or less is reached). It preserves the transformative value of the hydrogen-oxygen bonds, as it can sublimate back into liquid or gas state at a temperature above 0 Celsius.

**Global perspective**

Thanks to global warming, naturally occuring snow is a vision gradually more and more rare. As much as mountain peaks are whitened with snow pretty much all year long, the majority of land lucky enough to be in cold/moderate climate, experiences a snowfall only in winter season. With the lowering of temperature, a chance of snowfall increases.

The warmer countries around equator, without any mountains are the ones least likely to experience snow. Of course, with global warming and all the glaciers melting, the number of countries without snow will gradually grow larger. For example, there used to be a small ski area called Chacaltaya on a tall mountain in Bolivia, but that ski area has already closed permanently because of lack of snow.

**Emotional charge**

Snow can, depending on the cintext it appears in, evoke both positive and negative connections.

### Snowglobe

As snow exists somewhere between magical dust and natural disaster, so does an object of a snowglobe position itself on the border of cheap tchotchke and priceless memorabilia.

**Layers**

Every snowglobe consists of the following layers:

1. The Name

  known as snow domes , snow shakers, water domes, water balls, snow scenes and blizzard weights

2. The Snow Material

  The ''snow'' was made of ground rice, bone, ceramic, camphor and wax or porcelain; today it is almost always tiny bits of plastic.

  isn't that accurate? it used to be snowing snow, but now, because of our need to own things, it snowing plastic.

  how accurate is it that in the majority of mainstream snowglobes, which are supposed to be reminiscent of a magical event of snow globe, it already snows plastic (instead more natural materials like rice, wax, bone). Perhaps one day the snow on our Earth globe will follow. As the natural occurence of snow decreasee, the amount of plastic covering our planet increases.

  One of our unique designs included a 120mm snowglobe on a solid silver base which was given to President Bill Clinton. The snowglobe contained the original confetti which was thrown at his inauguration party.

3. The Liquid

  In the 1960's, several children got sick when they drank the contents of domes filled with polluted water taken directly from Hong Kong Harbor. In the 1950's, one manufacturer, finding that water froze when his inventory was being shipped, began adding antifreeze. Today, many manufacturers still add potentially lethal chemicals to prevent freezing and to thicken the water so the flakes drift through slowly.

  there were domes send from Canada that had liquid metaamphetamine in it   [https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/26/world/liquid-meth-snow-globes-australia-trnd/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/26/world/liquid-meth-snow-globes-australia-trnd/index.html)

4. The Vessel

  In the early 1950's, plastic began to take the place of glass as a material for the globe itself.

5. Base

  doesnt really matter as long as its waterproof, most popular choices include plastic

6. Subject

**Snow globe - more than a tchotchke**

Very informative [text](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/pdf/SpaceAndCulture.pdf "Space and Culture") by Freeman on hidden potential of snowglobes, of which below a selection of excerpts is presented.

>While at first glance, snow globes might seem trite or trivial objects, on closer reflection, they are revealed to be symbolic realms that provide clues to the desires, dreams, nightmares, and memories of the cultures that produce them.

>A snowglobe can seem a frustrating object because it does not appear to offer opportunities to create change, only the temporary disruption of a snowstorm or total disruption by smashing.

>Thinking critically about the hermetically sealed worlds of snow globes
opens up riddles of modern life. It brings attention to our size, to ourselves, and to the worlds we inhabit and create. The art of catastrophe expressed in disaster snow globes points out our faults and our fears, but allows us to give them a shake. As we shake them, they shake us.

### The Subject

**Marx and Engels**

| ![Marx and Engels](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/marxengels.jpg "Marx and Engels") |
|--|
| Picture of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels together |

Karl Marx, in full Karl Heinrich Marx, (born May 5, 1818, Trier, Rhine province, Prussia [Germany]—died March 14, 1883, London, England), revolutionary, sociologist, historian, and economist. He published (with Friedrich Engels) Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei (1848), commonly known as The Communist Manifesto, the most celebrated pamphlet in the history of the socialist movement. He also was the author of the movement’s most important book, Das Kapital. These writings and others by Marx and Engels form the basis of the body of thought and belief known as Marxism. (See also socialism; communism.)

Friedrich Engels, (born Nov. 28, 1820, Barmen, Rhine province, Prussia [Germany]—died Aug. 5, 1895, London, Eng.), German socialist philosopher, the closest collaborator of Karl Marx in the foundation of modern communism. They coauthored The Communist Manifesto (1848), and Engels edited the second and third volumes of Das Kapital after Marx’s death.

**Similar Objects in IISG**

Apart from the Snowglobe With Marx And Engels, there are other objects connected to the German philosopher

|![object1](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/object1.jpg)|![object2](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/object2.jpg)|![object3](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/object3.jpg)|![object4](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/object4.jpg)|
|--|--|--|--|

Seeing the mentioned snowglobe next to these objects, we cannot help, but notice that they are not primarily objects of preservation, but rather of mockery.

In the modern age, after the fall of USSR, we are experiencing a new approach to the icons of communism, especially in post-soviet countries. Dictators (Stalin), leaders (Lenin) or idealists (Marx) are commodified and turned into symbols, often ending up as a low quality T-shirt print or edgy cup available online or next to major tourist attraction from Warsaw to Budapest.

|![stalin matches](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/stalinmatches.gif)|![hot stalin](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/hotstalin.jpg)|![t-shirt stalin](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/tshirtstalin.jpg)|
|--|--|--|


There are however some objects which pose a certain difficulty in judging their intended use. This snowglobe with an image of Stalin from Stalin Museum in Georgia looks like a cheao souvenir, but there is a chance it was an actual dear reminder of the beloved leader kept safely at home by his admirers.

![georgiastalin](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/stalinglobe.jpg width="60%")

**The Face In A globe**

Generally speaking, in order to achieve a similar effect of absurdity that this specific artefact holds, it doesn't matter that it's Marx's figure put in there. It could be Stalin, Mao, any 'politically serious' person of recent past with mostly negative or at least controversial connotations and we would relate to it in a similar way - in the future it might be Trump or Putin that will land in such a globe, if they haven't already.

List of traits for someone's figure to be put in that globe and have similar effect of absurdity:
  1. recognizable face
  2. a person with serious background (as in powerful enough to have caused some socio-political stir)
  3. general public has negative or at least controversial connotations to that person
  4. person of recent past (wouldn't work with king from 500 years ago)

However, it is specifically Marx that we see in there, so a few possibly over-interpreted connections come to mind of a contemporary viewer:

1. Shaking a snow globe = communist revolution that shook the world (and yet it all goes back to calmness as snow falls in a globe)
2. Devaluation of a snowglobe is parallel to certain devaluation of Marx
  - snow globes were once expensive memorabilia, now a cheap souvenir
  - Marx was once a person of serious hope, idealist, a **real** person, later turned into an ideological icon by bad propaganda (positioned next to Lenin, Stalin etc), an icon that never really existed:
      - *Marx as the one who offered salvation to proletariat*
      - *Marx as the prophet*
      ![Marx next to Lenin](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/badpropaganda.png width="60%")

3. Commodification of marxism especially in post-soviet countries (edgy souvenirs) is parallel to commodification of a snow globe (valued memorabilia → cheap tchotchke)


### The Inscriptions

On the snowglobe we can find two textual additions: 'CLAY GENET' on the back of the sculpture and 'Schnee von gestern?!' in front of it

**CLAY GENET**

*Meaning*

Unfortunately, the IISG is unable to inform what is the meaning of that inscription. Research leads only as far as to show that Genet is a slender cat-like animal with a long body, a long ringed tail, large ears, a pointed muzzle and partly retractile claws. And there are figurines of it made out of clay.

|![genet](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/genet.jpg)|![claygenet](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/research/images/claygenet.jpg)|
|--|--|
| representative of genet species | a genet animal made out of clay

However, there does not seem to be any connection between a genet and Marx.

*Function*

The reason why inscription was made is unknown. It is supposed that it can be the name of the author, but no such person was found. Moreover, the snowglobe is probably an example of a mass produced object (which is rarely individually signed). The only information about the origin of the artefact is that it once was spotted on a souvenir market by a staff member of IISG and brought back to the archive, mostly as a bit of a joke, but also to enrich its collection on Marx.

**Schnee von gestern?!**

*Meaning*

The inscription is made in German and literally translates to *Snow of yesterday* or *Yesterday's snow*.

"Schnee von gestern" is a way of saying that something is already a thing of the past, something old, unimportant that has no more relevance to the discussed topic or is not worthy of worrying about. Its English synonym is 'water under the bridge'.

There are three German documentary movies entitled *Schnee von gestern*
- by director Michael Würfel from 2008
- by the directors Claus Oppermann and Gerald Grote from 2008
- by director Yael Reuveny from 2013

None of them relates to the artefact.

*Function*

Function of the inscription is unknown, but there are some clues. *Snow of yesterday?!* in a snowglobe is an obvious play on words. Exclamation and question mark at the end of the sentence suggest teasing the viewer to question the object and the person it encapsulates with its plastic vessel. The final effect is a certain commentary pun, making the one who hold the artefact wonder, whether the ideology of Marxism is the thing of the past, whether the world will be shook by it again and what all of it really means.


## Transcoding
The resilience of any archived object largely relies on its adaptability to a variety of media. Technology comes in, but also dies out at dizzying pace. Innovative technologies (CD, VHS), prevailing the market just 20 years ago are now considered out of date, which majorly impedes the process of retrieving the information held on them.

The artefact of *The Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* has been translated into different formats - using both coding and more analogue techniques of such inter-media translation. Every attempt at transcoding takes on a different aspect of the globe, analysing and preserving it, in hope that when viewed collectively, transcoded versions of the original will be able to reflect not only the physicality of the *The Snowglobe*, but also its socio-political relevance and emotional response it may have once evoked.

**Description**

On the website of IISG we can read that the material used for the *Snowglobe with Marx and Engels* is glass. Unfortunately, that information is wrong. It is plastic. And that distinction is quite important in uderstanding that object. Plastic evokes feelings of kitsch and cheapness, glass of craftsmanship and refinement. The only thing that connects the two materials is transparency and water resistance.

The snowglobe is in its most reductive form is just a set of figurines packaged in transparent, water-resistant material. However, I want to show the immediate difference one can feel when interacting with a plastic material vs glass material.

**Materials**

I started with collecting different kinds of plastic and glass packagings.

|--|--|--|
| *Examples of plastic packages* |

After looking at the above examples of packagings, I decided that in order to fully translate all the core elements of the snowglobe (the transparent globe, the figure of Marx and the text), I need to add a label for the inscription 'Schnee van gestern?!'. Not only does that complete the translation, but also immediately evokes terms of disposability, saleability and it commodifies the snowglobe into a ready-made labelled product, with even a functional barcode (created using [this website](https://barcode.tec-it.com)) that after scanning reveals the original IISG classification number of the object.

In order to represent the figure of Marx in its most reductive way and be able to put it into packages of different forms and sizes, I decided to 3D print it. Later, I noticed that just the head of Marx will communicate better than the whole bust, so I decided to edit it in 3D editing software Cinema 4D.

*3D printing the figurines*

For the printing I used a the [Anycubic Photon S – UV Resin DLP 3D Printer](https://www.elektor.nl/anycubic-photon-s-uv-resin-dlp-3d-printer). It is a printer that uses UV-reactive resin, which as the printing progresses, solidifies. That kind of printing allows for a significantly more detailed print.

**Description**

Unfortunately, the original record kept on IISG website is a record of multiple errors. Together with an image of extremely low quality, the classification provided by the website leaves the interested in confusion and doesn't provide much relevant help for researchers.


[<img src="https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T2/images/wrongrecord.jpg" width="80%">](https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/991455)

I started with an attempt at improving the record. Sadly, a lot of information (such as author or exact history of the object could not be obtained to the day).

After the correction however, I noticed the hidden potential of the errors in the IISG's record. They reminded me of phrenology, mysterious medieval book illustrations, alchemic manuscripts (like [The Voynich Manuscript](http://www.voynich.nu/)) or scientific etchings from early colonial age, in which the explorers tried to note down their (often mistaken) observations about local communities, whose habits and even looks very completely alien to them.

[this website](https://www.strangescience.net/stmons.htm) was very helpful in finding examples.


**Methods and Materials**

In the context of connection to early scientific illustration, resorting to etching seemed like the most intuitive choice of technique.

*[Etching](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/e/etching) is a printmaking technique that uses chemical action to produce incised lines in a metal printing plate which then hold the applied ink and form the image*

| ![](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T2/images/etching.jpg) |
|--|
| *example of an etching plate together with a print* |

In the current situation, etching, even though it would be my preferred technique of producing the outcome, is impossible. I decided to try linocut technique instead.

A [linocut](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/l/linocut) is a relief print produced in a manner similar to a woodcut but that uses linoleum as the surface into which the design is cut and printed from

**Production**

I started with sketching an idea of what kind of element I would like to show on the final print.

List of misinterpretations:

- there are no measurements in the description, so I imagined the globe could be completely out of proportion, human-sized significantly smaller or bigger than the original
- I thought a viewer, seeing the IISG description without a context could think that Marx and Engels are one organism monster with two heads
- the inscription of 'CLAY GENET' should lead to an image of actual genet animal
- the black base of the globe has 3 legs - maybe the globe is an organism in itself and can move?
- the base on which figurines are standing has actually two colors - half is black and half is white, I would like to attempt at assigning some meaning to that division
- description in the archive states that the snow inside the globe is black, I would like to refer to it in some way
- The water is very murky and soapy, maybe something can be noticed there
- IISG describes the location of the object to be Germany and the time period between 1988 and 1993, I would like that to be also prominently shown on the print

In the near future the word *snow* might become an anachronism. As global warming progresses, snow is more and more of a rare sight. And without its natural occurence, its relatability is lost. Phenomena like TV static/snow, visual snow syndrome or 'yesterday's snow' would be named differently if snow did not exist anymore.

| MEDIUM | website |
| RESULT | generator of divinations based on excerpts from Marx's *Das Kapital* |


**Description**

*Initial Concept*

*Usually, a snow globe has only image-based content inside of it (as in pictures or sculptures). In this transcoding I would like to not only put words into the globe, but also through multi-level construction (as in complex Diney's snowglobes) allow for arbitrary narrative creation. Each small globe within a greater construction would be similar to a Magic8Ball.

| ![](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/disney1.jpg)

| Examples of Disney's multi-level snowglobe |

| ![](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/magic8ball.jpg)
|--|
| Magic8Ball |

In an analogue version each globe would have a small transparent opening at the top and a dice inside of it. After the globe has been shook one of the sides of the dice floats to the top, revealing a word. Among other consecutive words a narrative is created.

In a digital version the construction would rely on randomly selected words from a few array (one array for each globe).*

At the beginning of the project I wanted to create a physical, analogue, but interactive sculpture consisting of multiple smaller snowglobes, each of them functioning as a Magic8Ball. Later in the process, I decided to build an online platform for divinations instead. Each divination consists of a excerpt from Marx's *Das Kapital* and a set of randomly assigned nouns that, every time the tool is used, open themselves up to new interpretations, which is an integral part of any esoteric attempt at prediciing the future.

**Material**

As the source material I used the [original text](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/Capital-Volume-I.pdf) of the first volume of *Das Kapital*

**Quotes**

*Selection of original quotes from *Das Kapital* by Karl Marx*:

1. “Education is free. Freedom of education shall be enjoyed under the condition fixed by law and under the supreme control of the state”

2. “As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.10”

3. “Perseus wore a magic cap down over his eyes and ears as a make-believe that there are no monsters.”

4. "Work, thrift and greed are therefore his three cardinal virtues."

*The same quotes with removed nouns*:

1. “_______ is free. _______ of _______ shall be enjoyed under the condition fixed by _______ and under the supreme control of _______”

2. “As, in _______, man is governed by the _______ of his own _______, so in _______, he is governed by the _______ of his own _______.”

3. “_______ wore a _______ down over his _______ and _______ as a make-believe that there are no _______.”

4. "_______, _______ and _______ are therefore his three cardinal virtues."


**Nouns**

In order to later fit the sentences grammatically, I had to divide the nouns into singular and plural.

| singular | plural |
|--|--|
| - education | - virtues
| - freedom | - products
| - law | - monsters
| - state
| - religion
| - brain
| - hand
| - perseus
| - magic cap
| - work
| - thrift
| - greed


**Production**

I started with picking one sentence and replacing its nouns with the nouns from the general selection. The nouns are assigned randomly by the code - each empty spot has its own array from which it selects either singular or plural nouns. The underlined spots are for singular ones, the dotted for plural. Each time the website is refreshed a newly generated sentence appears.

![First working try-out of a generative sentence](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/sentence1.gif "First working try-out of a generative sentence")

As the words are selected randomly by the computer, they do not necessarily make logical sense, but they are still selected from the same book - Das Kapital. Because of that their vernacular relations make a lot of sense and all generated sentences relate to the original, just in a new abstract sense. The created sentences seem to be mysteriously ambiguous and yet, not completely senseless, which allows for individual interpretation of them - as it happens with any ritual of divination.

Shaking a snowglobe is crucial to revealing the true magic of the scene it holds. I realised that it is crucial to preserve that movement in some way. Instead of clicking on a refresh button every time to refresh a website, I decided to use the shake-event availabkle on a mobile phone. Every time a user will shake his phone, a new sentence will appear.

As the starting point, I used the [shake.js library](https://alexgibson.github.io/shake.js/) from Alex Gibson.

I augmented to code and checked if [my result](https://ada-popovic.github.io/markdown_archive/T5/working_shake_event) worked on a Huawei P30. Unfortunately, the website functions properly only on Android devices. On laptops a new sentence will still be generated after refreshing the website.

| Before shaking | After shaking |

Later, I tried adding to the [website](https://ada-popovic.github.io/markdown_archive/T5/Divination_Generator_shake) the refresh action on shake event. For now the content is misaligned, as it is just a check of functionality.

| Before shaking | Alert appearing on shake event | After shaking |
|--|--|--|
| ![Before shaking](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/beforeshake2.jpg "Before shaking") | ![After shaking](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/alert.jpg "Alert") | ![After shaking](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/aftershake2.jpg "After shaking") |

I have added the nouns as a < span > element in the html so that their replacement is easier and works in every screen size.
| ![](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/span1.jpg) | ![](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/span2.jpg) | ![](https://github.com/ada-popovic/markdown_archive/blob/master/T5/images/span3.jpg)  |
|--|--|--|



Apart from the basic sentence randomisation I was thinking about adding categories for each sentence such as:

- love
- life
- work
- money
- friendship

In this way each sentence would give an advice for a specific life domain of the user.

## Reflection
During this semester I was planning to make quite a lot of physical, analogue projects next to my coding-related endeavours. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19 crisis, we were forced to present the outcomes in a digital way, which influenced my decision process for majority of transcodings.
